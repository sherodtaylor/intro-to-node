One of the best ways to learn Node.js is to use Node REPL (“Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop”)

Node REPL is an interactive Node.js programming environment.
  
1) Start Node Repl in your terminal

  sherodtaylor:~ $ node 


REPL is useful for debugging and playing around with javascript.

  sherodtaylor:~ $ node 
  > 2 * 2
  4
  > for (var i = 0, l = 5; i < l; i++) {
  ....  console.log(i);
  .... }
  1

  5

To Exit click CTRL-C twice
  > 
  (^C again to quit)
  sherodtaylor:~ $
